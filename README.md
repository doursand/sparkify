# sparkify
using spark and machine learning to predict users churn

### Summary
This is the Capstone project for the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree
In this project one needs to analyse a tiny subset representation of a much larger spark dataset (12 Gb) containing information about users behaviours of a music streaming app/service (Sparkify)
The small dataset version contains only 2 months of logs
The ultimate goal is to identify which parameters are the most likely to conduct the users to churn / leave the service

### Requirements
This project requires the following python libraries

- pyspark
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- jupyter notebook

### Files Description


### Result
Results are described in the jupyter notebook attached to this repo
